# Linux Kernel C Style Guidelines

Follow these key conventions:

- Use tabs, not spaces, for indentation (`indent with tab = 8`).
- No C++ style `//` comments â€” use `/* */`.
- Max line length: 80 characters.
- No CamelCase: use `snake_case` for function and variable names.
- One statement per line.
- Function names should be `verb_noun()`.
